# Easy-Kindle: Project Specification

## Project Vision

Easy-Kindle is a command-line tool that enables users to send web articles, documents, and books to their e-reader devices (Kindle, Kobo, Remarkable, etc.) via email. The tool automatically converts web content into optimized e-book formats and delivers them directly to the user's device.

## Core Purpose

The primary goal is to solve the problem of reading web content on e-readers, which typically have limited web browsing capabilities. By converting online articles, blog posts, and documentation into e-book formats, users can enjoy a distraction-free reading experience on their preferred e-ink devices.
